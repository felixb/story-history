# 🤖 story-history

> A lightweight, AI-crafted personal story history tracker for Jira.

This tool maintains a localized view of your Jira tickets, providing quick insights into your progress and sprint
velocity without the heavy Jira UI.

### ✨ Key Features

- 📂 **Local Caching**: Minimizes Jira API requests by storing ticket data locally.
- 📋 **Ticket Reporting**:
    - **Open Tickets**: Lists your tracked tickets with direct browser links.
    - **Authored by Me**: Automatically finds and lists open tickets you've reported.
    - **Auto-tracking**: The `track` command automatically adds Jira tickets assigned to you to your tracking list.
- 📊 **Sprint Analytics**: Sums up story points (SP) per sprint, distinguishing between closed and total capacity.
- ⏱️ **Time Tracking**: Log and report spent hours on tickets or common tasks.
- 🔍 **Field Discovery**: Includes a utility to help find your Jira instance's specific custom field IDs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Jira Ticket Tracking
Run the main script to see your current ticket status and sprint progress:
```bash
./main.py
```

To automatically track new tickets assigned to you:
```bash
./main.py track
```

### 2. Time Tracking
Log hours for the current day:
```bash
# Add 1.5h to the default account (common)
./main.py hours -add 1.5

# Add 2h to a specific ticket and show the log
./main.py hours -add 2.0 PROJECT-123 -log

# Show weekly summary in short format
./main.py hours -log -short
```

## 🛠 Configuration

The tool uses a `config.yaml` file to connect to your Jira instance and track specific tickets.

```yaml
jira:
  url: https://your-jira-instance.com/jira # The base URL of your Jira instance
  token: your-jira-personal-access-token # Your Jira personal access token
  fields:
    story_points: customfield_10006 # The custom field ID for Story Points
    sprint: customfield_10000 # The custom field ID for Sprint
  closed_statuses: # Jira statuses considered "closed" for reporting
    - Done
    - Closed
tickets: # List of Jira ticket keys to track explicitly
  - PROJECT-123
  - PROJECT-456
common_label: common # The default label for hours not assigned to a specific ticket
```

> [!TIP]
> If you don't know the custom field IDs for Story Points and Sprint, run:
> `uv run python discover_fields.py`

## 🧪 Testing

To run the logic tests, use:

```bash
uv run pytest
```
